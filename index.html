			<h2>What Is Polygon Crypto Network?</h2>

<p>Polygon (formerly Matic Network) is a layer-2 platform that aims at creating a more decentralized scaling solution for Ethereum-based apps without sacrificing security.

<p>It is designed to be Ethereum&rsquo;s internet of blockchains, making it easy for developers to connect across blockchains networks that are Ethereum-compatible.</p>

<p>Due to the fixed supply, it relies on a token pool allocated to staking rewards to incentivize validators.</p>
